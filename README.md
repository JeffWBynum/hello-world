# hello-world
Just starting to code! Really enjoying it so far:-)

My name is Jeff and I'm looking for a career change. I love what I do (I've worked in hospitality and special events for 15 years) but Covid has pretty much killed the entire industry. A few of my friends have taught themselves coding over the years and switched fields. After hearing how much they liked their new profession I thought I'd give it a try! I know it'll be a lot of hard work but so far I'm having a great time learning something new. I think its going to be an awesome experiance and can't wait to dive in more. Wish me luck!
